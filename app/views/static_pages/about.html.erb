    <h1>Notes to Grader</h1>
    <p>
      We did not impliment the feature of posting on each other's walls. We lost time attempting to get account security better in place, and also getting everything to work on the Heroku servers. Though it was more for lack of time, we are still happier to have a better understanding of user accounts and user security than making a sub connection of friendships and incorperating inter-user posting. We know that it would not be difficult to complete since we do have posting and friendships individually, but are choosing to smooth our other errors instead of adding a semi-functioning aspect to the website.

      However, we did add a few extra features as we went along. Users are able to have avatars, though we were not able to impliment uploading your own pictures. Additionally, we used bootstrap for layout design. Users also have the ability to delete or edit statuses that they've made individually, should they choose.
